Dirty Cargo Extender will exame every station inside a sector,
if a station is a producing station (generates goods), and doesnt have enough cargo space to store 10,000 units(configurable) of each good that station produces. Then the mod will Extend the cargo of that station.

It will then mark that station with a variable, so further checks on an already checked station doesnt happen again.

This script works on all mines, and sizez of producing stations.

The script is optimized to perform quickly with little to know performance.
